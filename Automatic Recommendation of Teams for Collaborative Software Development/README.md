# Automatic Recommendation of Teams for Collaborative Software Development
Here is the source code that we used in {title of paper}.

## Running Experiment
Since this research was broken down into many sections, the instruction for running/compile/execute on each section will be written in __README.md__ on each folder of each part.

The order for running the code are as follows:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Topic Modeling
3. Network Generation
4. Feature enginering
5. Model Selection
6. Evaluation

## Support
If you have any questions on this project or get stuck during code execution, feel free to create issue on this repository together with `hitnothit` label.
We will generate the assignee team by using our code to fix your issue.

## Data
The raw data, preprocessed data, and the result of team recommendation can be download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D12UKF_05uh4AS9XiLdocxEP8nqFcS8q?usp=sharing).
